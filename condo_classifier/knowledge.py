"""Retrieval over the building's FAQ, so the bot can answer common questions from facts.

The bot retrieves the closest FAQ entries for a resident's message and gives them to the
chat model as context (retrieval-augmented generation). Retrieval is TF-IDF over each
entry's question and keywords: local, fast and provider-neutral. Swap in embeddings later
by keeping `search` the same.
